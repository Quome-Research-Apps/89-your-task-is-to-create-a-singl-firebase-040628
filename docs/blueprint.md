## Core Features:

- Dynamic Category Input: Allows users to dynamically add grade categories (e.g., Homework, Exams) with name, weight, and score inputs.
- Weight Validation: Validates that the sum of all category weights equals 100%. Displays an error message if the total is not 100.
- Real-Time Weight Total: Displays a running total of the entered weights to help the user manage their category weighting effectively.
- Grade Calculation: Calculates the final grade based on the weighted average of the entered category scores and weights: Final Grade = Î£ (Weight_i * Score_i).
- Grade Display: Displays the calculated final grade as a percentage in a prominent location.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Lavender (#D0C2FF) to evoke a sense of calm focus.
- Background color: Light off-white (#FAFAFF) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale Purple (#B4A7E6) to highlight important actions and feedback messages.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that is both modern and a little warm, providing readability.
- Use a clear, linear layout to guide the user through the process of entering categories, weights, and scores. Keep CTAs clear.
- Subtle transitions on input fields, button hovers and on calculations to make the experience feel responsive and less utilitarian.
